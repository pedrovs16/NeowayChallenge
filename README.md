 This challenge was made by Neoway. The challenge was collecting data from correios website (http://www.buscacep.correios.com.br/sistemas/buscacep/buscaFaixaCep.cfm) about at least 2 UF's and write the results in a JSONL file, using python. For this challenge i made two way to do that, a app with interface to select which UF's you want to get or using a IDLE.
