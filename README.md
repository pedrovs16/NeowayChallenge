# Data Pirates
##  About the challenge
 This challenge was made by Neoway. The challenge was collecting data from correios website (http://www.buscacep.correios.com.br/sistemas/buscacep/buscaFaixaCep.cfm) about at least 2 UF's and write the results in a JSONL file, using python. For this challenge i made two way to do that, a app with interface to select which UF's you want to get or using a IDLE.
 ## How to use the app
  1. First you need to download the folder nameD by "app"
  2. Open 'Interfacee' than will open this
  <img alt="IMG1" title="IMG1"  src="IMG1.png">

  3. Chose the UF's you want to get data and the file name
  <img alt="IMG2" title="IMG2"  src="IMG2.png">
<hr>
  4. Will apper this, but only ignore
  <img alt="IMG3" title="IMG3"  src="IMG3.png">
<hr>
  5. Now the dates are being collected
  <img alt="IMG4" title="IMG4"  src="IMG4.png">

  6. When appear "JSON formado." mean that the file was created, you can see in app folder and the data will be like this
  <img alt="IMG5" title="IMG5"  src="IMG5.png">
  <img alt="IMG6" title="IMG6"  src="IMG6.png">
   ```json
   {"uf": "RS", "id": 1, "localidade": "Acegu\u00e1", "faixa-de-cep": "96445-000 a 96449-999"}
   {"uf": "RS", "id": 2, "localidade": "\u00c1gua Santa", "faixa-de-cep": "99965-000 a 99969-999"}
